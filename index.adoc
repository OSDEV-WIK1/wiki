= The New OSDev Wiki

Welcome to osdev.wiki.

The goal of this wiki is to modernize the information found in the long-standing OSDev wiki found at https://wiki.osdev.org[wiki.osdev.org] and to decentralize it. It is currently *WIP* and *not ready* for use.

This wiki is not endorsed by, does not have any connection to, and is not related in any way with another wiki found at https://wiki.osdev.org[wiki.osdev.org].

description: How to use Visual Studio, with either MSVC or Clang for OS development.

This page describes how to use *Visual Studio* as an IDE and build system for OS
development.
The use of the Clang toolchain is recommended, but using Microsoft's native
MSVC compiler is possible as well.

[CAUTION]
.MSVC for OSDev
====
It is possible to use MSVC for OS development, but it is heavily advised
against for a number of reasons.

* It is proprietary and not properly documented.
* It is difficult and sometimes impossible to do certain things required for OS
  development using a pure MS toolchain.
* Few people will be willing to provide help when something goes wrong.

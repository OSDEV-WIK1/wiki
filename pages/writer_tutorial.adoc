== Writing the AsciiDoc
The wiki consists of documents written in AsciiDoc under the `pages/` directory
in the source tree.
Documents are prefaced with a nonstandard preamble containing page metadata.
This preamble is surrounded by `---` and is a standard YAML document.
The following fields are required:

- `title`: The document title,
- `tags`: A comma separated list of page tags (see a list of current tags on
  link:/tags[the tag index page]),
- `category`: The main category of this page (see a list of current categories
  on link:/categories[the category index page]),
- `description`: A brief description of the page (to show in overviews and
  OpenGraph metadata).

The convention for the names of documents on the wiki is
`pages/snake_case_slug.adoc`.

Categories are defined in a YAML-formatted category description mapping in the
`categories.yaml` file.

=== References and bibliographies
We use https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bibtex[asciidoctor-bibtex] to
emit bibliographies and references on the wiki.
If you wish to cite something, first check whether `sources.bib` in the root of
the repository has the document you wish to cite and if it's metadata is
correct, if your entry isn't present, or is incorrect, please update it.

When adding references to a page, please add the following to the end of the
document in order to render its bibliography:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Bibliography
bibliography::[]
----

=== Things of note
- Written documents will be prefixed with their title emitted as a level zero
  heading automatically.
  Start with level one headings (`==`) when dividing up documents.
- All AsciiDoctor features _should_ work.
  If there is a construct we missed and is broken, it is likely a bug in the
  generator.
  Please report it.

== Submitting your changes
When submitting your change, please confirm it adheres to our
xref:guidelines.adoc[style guidelines] and make commits accordingly.
Please ensure these commits are atomic and encompass one change each.

After you are done, push your changes to a fork of our source repository and
submit a pull request.
It will then be reviewed by our editorial team and merged if appropriate.

We suggest that you enable GitHub actions on your fork and use them to ensure
your pages look like what you intended them to.
Our workflows will push changes to `gh-pages` on the same repository.
You might need to create that branch, even if empty.

// TODO(arsen): make creating the branch unnecessary.

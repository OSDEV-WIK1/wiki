---

== Content guide
. The style guide will always leave some leeway, since there is no single best
  way of doing something, but the overall style should be consistent _within_
  an article and may be different _across_ articles.
  This also means one should keep the current style when expanding an article.
  An article's style should only be changed when there is good reason to.
+
NOTE: Inconsistent styling within an article might cause confusion to the
      reader, however imposing one arbitrary decision across the entire wiki
      will be cumbersome and will be of limited use.
      In addition, different topics may require different treatment.

. An article should be structured as follows:

* Warning templates
+
NOTE: This is the first thing any reader should see.

* Lead section (a short, self-contained overview of the topic)
+
NOTE: A reader should be able to get a quick overview of the topic without
      reading a long text.
      A person encountering the article should be able to assess quickly, if
      they are interested in reading it further or not.
      The lead section is also the part displayed in search engines and social
      media embeds.

* Main matter

* See also (internal links to tangentially related topics that might be of
  interest to the reader, in order to facilitate navigation)
+
NOTE: The reader will be able to easily find articles they want to read next.

* Further reading (external links, books, etc ..., such as tutorials,
  references, and documentation, that might be of interest to someone writing
  an OS)
+
NOTE: The wiki cannot and should not cover everything, it serves as a starting
      point for further research.

* References (list of inline citations that appear as footnotes throughout the
  article)

. American English spelling and terminology used in technical literature should
  be used when writing articles.
  However, terms that are widely used across all English-speaking countries
  should be preferred over terms used exclusively in the US.
+
NOTE: Most technical literature is written in American English.

. An article should be logically divided into sections and subsections.
+
NOTE: It facilitates navigation of long articles.
      Sections may appear in search engine results.

* Article and section titles should be written in sentence case (first letter
  of first word capitalized) and should not contain redundant "the" or "a".
  This means "BIOS", not "The BIOS".
  Exception: proper names.

* A subsection title should not redundantly contain the title of its parent
  section.
+
NOTE: Do not repeat yourself.

* Avoid markup in article and section titles.
+
NOTE: They appear in cross-references, tables of contents and search engine
      results.
      Use of certain markup may cause unforeseen problems.

. Every claim in an article should be sourced, preferably using inline
  footnotes.
  Primary sources (official documentation, references or specifications) should
  be preferred over secondary ones, unless primary sources are not available or
  have errors.
+
NOTE: The reader should be able to easily verify the correctness of content.
      Factual errors and hearsay should also be avoided.

* Claims in the lead section must not have an inline citation, if they appear
  in the main matter.
+
NOTE: Do not repeat yourself.

. Articles should have a neutral point of view.
  They should not prefer a certain solution over another one, when the
  alternative is also widely used (avoid holy wars).
  However, arguments for and against a solution may be presented in an
  objective and sourced way.

* If opinions must be included, they must be quoted from a source.
+
NOTE: The wiki is not a place for holy wars.
      Different people have different opinions and there is no objective way to
      settle all disputes.

* Modern methods and solutions should be emphasized over obsolete ones.
This does not mean that older technologies are not covered.
However, the reader must always be aware of legacy.
+
NOTE: This wiki should focus on modern OS development.

. If the title of an article is mentioned in another article, the first mention
  of that title should be linked.
+
NOTE: Navigation in any wiki lives from internal links.
      However, articles should not be cluttered with internal links.

* If a link to an article exists in the lead section, another link may exist in
  the main matter.

* An article may be linked more than once within a long article, but not more
  than once within the same section.
+
NOTE: The one link guideline should not get in the way of navigability.

. Code examples should be small self-contained snippets of code (as a rule of
  thumb, not larger than a screen).
  Articles should not be written as step-by-step tutorials.
+
NOTE: OS development requires a certain level of skill.
This includes being able to implement code based on a specification.
Providing large and complete code examples gives novice programmers the
incentive to simply copy and paste them, without fully understanding them.
OS development is not a linear process and there are a lot of choices that have
to be made.
Tutorials cannot cover the broadness of OS development.
Large code examples are also harder to test and maintain.
Buggy code should not be in the wiki.

* Code examples should be written in C.
  However, they must not be completely valid source files.
  For example, functions may be used that are not declared anywhere in the code
  snippet.
  Snippets should be vague and generic and should have pseudocode-like
qualities.
+
NOTE: C is the _lingua franca_ of programming languages and _the_ generic
      programming language.
      It is known by most programmers.
      In addition, it is a simple language that does not contain a lot of
      features that some programmers might not know.

* An exception to the C rule is low level code that must be written in
  assembly.
  Assembly is architecture-specific and therefore should be used only on
  architecture-specific pages or sections.
  When it comes to x86 assembly, the most convenient syntax (Intel or AT&T) in
  the relevant context should be used.

. Articles should be written in proper English with encyclopedic tone.
  A list of common things to look out for is provided.
  No rationale is provided, since these are common rules of English and are
  essentially linguistic conventions.

* General rules, grammar, tone and vocabulary

** Avoid repeating yourself.
   Avoid redundant phrases in sentences.
   Avoid long run-on sentences.
   For example, "OS development requires a certain level of skill" is preferred
   over "OS development requires the programmer to have a certain level of
   general skill".

** Articles should be written in encyclopedic tone, this includes _never_ using
   the first or second person ("I", "me", "you"), unless quoting.

** "The" should never be capitalized mid-sentence, unless it is part of a
   proper name.

** Plural forms of nouns are formed by using -s or -es, not -'s.

** Possessive forms of nouns are formed by using -'s.
+
IMPORTANT: "It" is not a noun, but a personal pronoun.
The corresponding possessive pronoun is "its", not "it's".

** Use the present tense by default.

** Avoid contractions like "can't" or "don't".

** Avoid language like "note", "remember" or "obviously", which either address
   the reader directly or makes presumptions about the reader's knowledge.

** Use gender-neutral language, avoid the use of "he" or "she".

** Abbreviations may be used in article or section titles, if they are used
   more commonly than the full expression (for example "BIOS" instead of "Basic
   Input/Output System").

** The first occurrence of an abbreviation must be written out, with the
   abbreviation following in parentheses: "Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)".

** Abbreviations may or may not include full stops, however no spaces may exist
   within the abbreviation ("B.I.O.S." is allowed, but "B. I. O. S." is not).
   However their use must be consistent and must follow conventions set in
   technical literature (use "BIOS", not "B.I.O.S.").

* Punctuation and symbols

** Do not use ampersands (&), use "and", unless quoting or part of a proper
   name like "AT&T".

** Use boldface to highlight an important term being introduced (such as the
   first occurrence of the article title), but do not use it more than once for
   the same term.
  For emphasis and foreign words, use italics.
  Do not italicize or boldface nearby punctuation.

** When quoting a source, the source must be mentioned _in the text_, in
   addition to having a footnote as reference.

** Straight quotes (") and apostrophes (') should be used (no curly quotes or
   apostrophes, no backticks, no low-high quotes, no guillemet).

** Nested quotes should use alternating quotes and apostrophes.

** Quotations should change the original text only minimally, any omitted,
   added, or changed words should be enclosed in square brackets.

** A comma before a quotation can be omitted, if the sentence is still
   grammatically correct and if the meaning of the quote is not changed.

** Punctuation may be included inside a quotation, if it makes logical sense
   and the punctuation is present in the original text.
   If isolated fragments of a sentence are quoted, nearby punctuation should
   usually be outside of the quote.

** An ellipsis consists of three dot characters (...) without spaces.
   They should be used when content is omitted from quotes.
   Square brackets may be placed around them to indicate that they are not part
   of the original quote.

** The main text may include side notes or clarifications in parentheses.
   However, the text around the parentheses must still make grammatical and
   logical sense without the content inside the parentheses.

** Nested parentheses should be avoided.
   Adjacent set of parentheses should also be avoided, the phrases should be
   joined by a comma.
   This means "the BIOS (a type of firmware) (replaced by UEFI)" is not
   allowed, and should be replaced by "the BIOS (a type of interface, replaced
   by UEFI)".

** Semicolons may be used to join two phrases that could stand as independent
   sentences: "stivale2 can load a kernel in long mode; multiboot cannot".
   Phrases that cannot stand alone may not be joined with a semicolon.

** Hyphens should be used to link prefixes ("quasi-multipliers") and compound
   modifiers ("well-known").

** Dashes may be used to punctuate a sentence, in order to indicate that the
   two surrounding phrases indicate a pair.
   They should be used sparingly.

** _Never_ put a space before punctuation.

* Dates and numbers

** Months and days of week are upper case, while seasons are lower case
   ("Monday", "July", "summer").

** Either use 12-hour ("2:45 pm" or "2:45 p.m.") or 24-hour dates ("14:45").
   Avoid "12 am" and "12 pm", when using the 12-hour format.
   Rather, use "noon" or "midnight".
   The latter is ambiguous, so specify whether it is the beginning or the end
   of the day.
   The 24-hour format has no such ambiguity "0:00" is the beginning of the day
   and "24:00" the end.

** Dates are either written as "19 December 2021" or "December 19, 2021".
Numerical dates may be written in the yyyy-mm-dd format: "2021-12-19".

** When omitting the year write either "19 December" or "December 19".

** When referring to months, use "December 2021".
You may use abbreviations like "Dec", if the space is limited.

** Avoid "#", use "No.", "Nos." or "number".

* List items should be formatted consistently and follow a certain "schema",
  such as being all complete sentences, sentence fragments or names.
  Mixing of different types of items should not occur.

. It is important to note that these are guidelines.
  They apply in the vast majority of cases, but there may be some rare
  exceptions.
  Exceptions should be introduced with care and with a good rationale.
+
NOTE: Not every edge case can be reasonably covered.

== AsciiDoc and source code style
As much as we strive for clean content, we should strive for clean source code.
The following guidelines will help ensure future contributors and/or editors of
the wiki have no problems making changes.

=== AsciiDoc formatting guidelines
For an AsciiDoc reference, please see the
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc
Syntax Quick reference] as well as the more broad
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc Language Documentation].

A useful tool for formatting your AsciiDoc is
https://www.nicemice.net/par/[`par`], though as it's not specific to AsciiDoc,
it will break formatting elements.
Use sparingly and explicitly, on ranges of text.

Full stops are line breaks::
  AsciiDoc does not care about line breaks, only paragraph breaks.
  By breaking lines on full stops, we minimize the chance of inducing conflicts
  with future contributors to the same page, but different parts.
  `par` violates this rule, so it is best to reformat a paragraph, break on
  full stops, and then rejoin lines to fit.
+

incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
----

Long lines should be broken::
  Long lines in the source code are hard to read.
  If your AsciiDoc sources include lines longer than 100 columns (including
  leading whitespace, for simplicity sake), hard wrap them.
  Many text editors can do this out of the box for you.

Links to other bits of AsciiDoc should be ``xref``s::
  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/xref/[`xref`] macros
  should be used to connect contents on the wiki.
  For this reason, please be careful when removing sections or IDs, at least
  until stronger verification is introduced.

Referenced sections should always have explicit IDs::
  For the sake of preventing issues induced by cross references, and for the
  sake of clarity, all cross references must be made to explicit anchors.
+

See <<section_1>>.

== Section 1
----

Leave comments for further editors::
  AsciiDoc supports comments.
  When something is not immediately obvious, or when something is left out, add
  a comment attributed to yourself.
  These should be in the format of `// TYPE(author): text`.
  `TYPE` should be `TODO`, `XXX`, `FIXME`, `NOTE`, etc.
  Please note that comments also tend to go stale, so their overuse is strongly
  discouraged.

// TODO(arsen): add xref validation

////
NOTE(steve): This paragraph is quite noteworthy!
             I should talk about it in more detail.
////
----

Align text elements, use 2-space indent::
  On text elements such as lists, align continuation lines (and in turn
  sentences) to the start of the text on the first line of the element.
  Indentation, for instance when writing definition lists, should be done in
  two space increments.
  We are dealing with text, not code; text is much more dense.
+
Exception: places where syntax makes it impossible to do otherwise.
[source,asciidoc]
----
. This first example demonstrates how to indent continuations.
  Isn't this lovely?

. This example is wrong.
Some would even consider it unintuitive.

Indentation::
  The blank space produced by indenting, often used for clarity of scope
+
Sadly, to insert a newline above this line, we must lose indentation here as to
not make this paragraph verbatim.
----

=== C source code formatting
As established, C is the _lingua franca_ of programming, all code that is not
platform-specific assembly should be written in C, with placeholders for
platform details (e.g. port I/O).
Here are a few guidelines on C code:

* Do not assume a compiler.
  If absolutely necessary, assume the common subset of Clang and GCC.
+
Exception: compiler-specific pages.

* Format code in the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_1TBS_(OTBS)[One True
  Brace Style].
+
This style is a variant of K&R with optional braces explicitly stated, and
opening braces of blocks on the same line as their respective statements.
Crucially, adding a line of code should never result in editing another line
(e.g. to add a brace) or result in flow that disagrees with indentation.
+
[source,c]
----
/* bad */
f1(int a, int b, int c)
{
  if (a)
  {
    return b + c;
  }
  else {
    return a * c;
  }
}

/* good */
int f1(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a) {
      return b + c;
    } else {
      return a * c;
    }
}
----

* The unit of indentation is four spaces, and alignment is allowed.
+
[source,c]
----
int function1(int a, /* carried over for demonstration sake */
              int b,
              int c) {
    /* ... */
}
----

* Use a `snake_case` naming convention, with names up to around 16 characters.
+
While modern compilers _are_ able to handle more, over-verbose function names
will lead to less readable code on the wiki.
Since code on the wiki should be considered pseudo-C and incomplete, there
is no need to worry about function names conflicting, and hence no need to
introduce namespacing (i.e. `whatever_` prefixes).


== Hard rules
These rules must not and cannot be broken under any conditions.
Violations of these rules will not be accepted under any circumstance.

. Absolutely no copyright violation.
  By submitting a contribution to this wiki, you irrevocably agree to release
  your contribution under the link:/licenses/CC0.txt[CC0 license] and certify
  that you have the right to do so.

. Commit messages must conform with the
  https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits]
  standard.

*  The following list contains some commit types that may be used:

** `deletion`: removal of a wiki article.

** `expansion`: expansion of a wiki article.

** `fix`: a minor fix that does not change the essence of the thing being
   changed (applies to all sections of the wiki).

** `feat`: introduction of a new feature (does not apply to edits of wiki
   articles).

** `generator`: changes to files related to site generation, other than CI.

** `new`: creation of a new wiki article.

** `ref`: changes to references.

** `style`: changes related to code or markup style, without changing the
   meaning of the code or markup itself.

** `trim`: partial removal of content form a wiki article.

* Commits should also contain a scope indicating what part of the repository
  has been changed:

** `ci`: changes related to CI.

** `content`: content articles of the wiki (i.e. articles about OSDev).

** `css`: CSS files in the `css` folder.

** `generator`: files related to the site generator.

** `html`: HTML files in the `html` folder.

** `static`: assets that go in the `static` folder.

** `meta`: articles in the wiki, related to rules and governance (i.e.
   articles with the category `Meta`).

** `misc`: other miscellaneous files.

* Commits changing articles should usually modify a single article, however
  frequent exceptions are allowed, especially for commits of the type `fix` and
  `style`.
  In case a single article is changed, the slug (i.e. filename without the
  filename extension) of the article must be listed as the scope of the commit.
  In case multiple articles, that are all members of a certain category or tag,
  are modified, that tag or category may be modified.

* The description of the commit must summarize all changes; descriptions must
  not be vague (e.g. "updated bios.adoc").

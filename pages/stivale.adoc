description: Brief introduction to the Stivale boot protocol.
---

*stivale* means "boot" in Italian.
It is a boot protocol designed to overcome shortcomings of common boot
protocols used by hobbyist OS developers, such as
xref:multiboot.adoc[Multiboot].

There are actually 2 revisions of the stivale boot protocol, namely:
*stivale*, and *stivale2*. The earlier stivale revision (simply "stivale",
but for clarity we are going to call it "stivale1" from now on), is a very
simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle["KISS"] boot protocol
only supporting what was deemed necessary at the time, but versioning and
expandability issues made creating stivale2 a necessity. stivale2 makes use
of tags for bootloader writers' and kernel writers' convenience, and to make
future expandability and revisioning easier.

NOTE: stivale1 is deprecated and should be avoided for new kernels.

stivale is firmware and architecture agnostic, though the only
bootloader fully supporting the stivale protocols as of writing
this article (2021/01/09) is xref:limine.adoc[], which is an
x86/x86_64 xref:bios.adoc[] and xref:uefi.adoc[] bootloader, with
https://github.com/TomatOrg/TomatBoot[TomatBoot] (now archived) and
https://github.com/FlorenceOS/Sabaton[Sabaton] offering limited stivale
compliance for xref:uefi.adoc#x86[x86_64 UEFI] exclusively, and
xref:arm.adoc#AArch64[aarch64], respectively.

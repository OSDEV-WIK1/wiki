*stivale* means "boot" in Italian. It is a boot protocol designed to overcome shortcomings of common boot protocols used by hobbyist OS developers, such as xref:multiboot.adoc[].

There are actually 2 revisions of the stivale boot protocol, namely: *stivale*, and *stivale2*. The earlier stivale revision (simply "stivale", but for clarity we are going to call it "stivale1" from now on), is a very simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle["KISS"] boot protocol only supporting what was deemed necessary at the time, but versioning and expandability issues made creating stivale2 a necessity. stivale2 makes use of tags for bootloader writers' and kernel writers' convenience, and to make future expandability and revisioning easier. Stivale1 is also depreciated and should not be used by new kernels, since stivale2 is more robust and still in active development. Stivale is also firmware and architecture agnostic, with a list of protocols implementing it down below.

.Stivale/Stivale2 Implementations
* xref:limine.adoc[Limine] - The refrence implementation of stivale/stivale2, created in 2019 to boot https://github.com/qword-os/qword[Qword-OS], and has since then evolved into a modern bootloader capable of booting https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Limine[Arch Linux] (and it has a clean ui!).
* https://github.com/FlorenceOS/Sabaton[Sabaton] - xref:arm.adoc#AArch64[aarch64] implementation of stivale2 in zig, with support for multiple SOCs (the only aarch64 implementation)
* https://github.com/TomatOrg/TomatBoot[TomatBoot] - Original xref:uefi.adoc#x86[x86_64 UEFI] implementation of stivale1/2 (partial compliance), and is now archived (superseded by xref:limine.adoc[Limine]
* https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/ion.git[Ion] - Another xref:uefi.adoc#x86[x86_64 UEFI] implementation of stivale2, also with partial compliance (seems to be inactive)

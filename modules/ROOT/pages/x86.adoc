== Overview
x86 is a complex-instruction-set, little-endian, 32-bit/64-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) introduced in 1985 by Intelfootnote:[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html]. It was preceded by the Intel 8086 architecture, a 16-bit CPU architecture from 1978.

== History
In 1984, Intel announced the Intel 80386 architecture (later renamed x86). The first processor to implement the full architecture was the Intel 386 in 1985. In 1989, the Intel 486 was introduced, with new features, such as:

 - An integrated "x87" FPU
 - L1 cache used for increased IPC
 - System management capabilities

To this day, every properly-implemented x86 processor has backwards compatibility, all the way back to the original Intel 8086.

== Operating Modes

x86 has a handful of operating modes, used for backwards compatibility.

=== Real Mode
Real mode is the operating mode that an x86 processor boots into. It mostly models the original 16-bit 8086 processor, with a few extensions.

While data can be handled 16 bits at a time, segment offset registers offer addressing up to 21 bits, which provides the processor with 1MiB of addressable memory.

Real mode contains no access rings or protection of any kind.

=== Protected Mode (16-bit)
16-bit protected mode runs with 16-bit data and instructions, but segment offset registers are replaced with segment selector registers, which point to an entry into the 16-bit GDT.

Programs written for real mode may have a handful of compatibility issues with 16-bit protected mode, but instructions are still read in the same format.

16-bit protected mode is rarely used.

=== Protected Mode (32-bit)
32-bit protected mode reads and addresses with 32-bit values. This is the mode commonly referred to as "protected mode". Protected mode mandates a 32-bit before entry. Protected mode is officially entered when a far jump is performed that sets CS to an offset which points to a code segment in a 32-bit GDT.

32 bits of addressing provide up to 4GiB of addressable virtual memory. However, with PAE paging extensions, the virtual address space can be mapped to 64-bit physical addresses, theoretically allowing up to 16PiB of physical memory to be addressed.

=== Compatibility Mode (x86-64 only)
Compatibility mode runs during the transition from protected mode to long mode. Compatibility mode runs similarly to protected mode, and is used to allow 64-bit structures to be loaded before entering proper long mode.

=== Long Mode (x86-64 only)
Long mode handles data up to 64 bits in general purpose registers, with extensions that allow for the handling of up to 512 bits of data at a time. Addressing in long mode is 64-bit, theoretically allowing for up to 16PiB of virtual memory to be *directly* addressed.

However, on most x86-64 processors, only 48 bits of addressing are actually implemented, with the notable exception of processors that support 5-level-paging. These 48-bit addresses must all have the top unsupported bits be set or unset, resulting in two "halves" of the virtual address space. These addresses are referred to as "canonical" addresses.

The name "long mode" refers to the commonplace technical term for a 64-bit integer, a "long".

Due to the unfulfillable amount of virtual memory, PAE paging is mandated in long mode. This allows for contiguous mapping of physical RAM, with memory-mapped IO out of physical RAM space. This also allows x86-64 operating systems to implement "swap memory", a process where virtual addresses point to data not in physical RAM, but rather stored on disk.

== Extensions
x86 processors have a plethora of extensions that expand on standard behavior. The most notable, x86-64, implements 64-bit addressing and long mode. 

(This section only contains a handful of extensions, there are too many to list at once.)

=== x86-64
The x86-64 extension is quite expansive, implementing the 64-bit operating mode and 64-bit addressing. It is nearly impossible to find a working computer today that does not support x86-64.

=== PAE/NX
PAE/NX implements 4-level paging, and adds a handful of properties to pages to implement extensive memory protection, including NX, a flag to disable execution on a particular page. 

Most operational computers today support PAE/NX.

=== x87
x87 is a floating-point calculation extension. While technically an extension, it is supported on most x86 processors.

=== SSE
SSE is a 128-bit data extension. It adds 8-16 128-bit general purpose `XMM` registers, and instructions to perform SIMD vector math. 

SSE has several versions. x86-64 processors are mandated to support at least SSE2.

=== AVX
AVX is a 256-bit data extension. It performs a purpose similar to SSE, and implements a handful of 256-bit `YMM` registers.

AVX was released alongside the Haswell microarchitecture in 2014. A not-insignificant number of operational computers today do not support AVX.

==== AVX-512
AVX-512 is not a single extension, but rather a family of extensions. It is similar to AVX, but implements a handful of 512-bit `ZMM` registers.

AVX-512 is quite new, with consumer processors supporting AVX-512 being released in 2018.footnote:[https://web.archive.org/web/20161023135525/http://www.legitreviews.com/intel-cannonlake-added-to-llvms-clang_179210] It is yet to become widely supported.
